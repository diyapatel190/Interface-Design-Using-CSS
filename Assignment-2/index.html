                <p class="lyrics">Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
                    You know that I caught it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
                    Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price<br>
                    You know that I bought it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
                    Killing me slow, out the window<br>
                    I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
                    Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
                    What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br>
                    And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
                    It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
                    And it's ooh-oh-oh<br>
                    It's a cruel summer<br>
                    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
                    No rules in breakable heaven<br>
                    But ooh, oh-oh<br>
                    It's a cruel summer<br>
                    With you<br>
                    Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine<br>
                    I'm not dying (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
                    We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
                    We're not trying (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
                    So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
                    I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
                    Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
                    And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br>
                    Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br>
                    It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
                    And it's ooh-oh-oh<br>
                    It's a cruel summer<br>
                    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
                    No rules in breakable heaven<br>
                    But ooh-oh-oh<br>
                    It's a cruel summer<br>
                    With you<br>
                    I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
                    And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
                    Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true<br>
                    I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
                    And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
                    Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
                    And I scream, "For whatever it's worth<br>
                    I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"<br>
                    He looks up, grinning like a devil<br>
                    It's new, the shape of your body<br>
                    It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
                    And it's ooh-oh-oh<br>
                    It's a cruel summer<br>
                    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
                    No rules in breakable heaven<br>
                    But ooh-oh-oh<br>
                    It's a cruel summer<br>
                    With you<br>
                    I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
                    And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
                    Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true<br>
                    I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
                    And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
                    Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
